# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts
## Background
In this repository, I was given several tasks that would use SQL in both PostgreSQL and 
Jupyter Notebook applications. Under the fictional scenario of me being hired as a new
data engineer at a company, I would be using Data Engineering and Data Analysis to help design 
the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions 
about the data.

### Setup
I first created an `EmployeeSQL` folder and placed a `Data` folder within. Inside the `Data` folder, 
I placed the CSV files. 

### Data Modeling
First, I inspected the CSVs and sketched out an ERD of the tables. That ERD was then exported 
as a PNG file and is located in the `EmployeeSQL` folder as "Data Modeling - ERD".png

### Data Engineering
Using the information I had, I created a table scheme for each of the six CSV files I was provided 
using a series of primary keys, foreign keys and composite keys depending on what each table needed. 
Once that was complete, I imported the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables.
