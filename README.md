# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts
## Background
In this repository, I was given several tasks that would use SQL in both PostgreSQL and 
Jupyter Notebook applications. Under the fictional scenario of me being hired as a new
data engineer at a company, I would be using Data Engineering and Data Analysis to help design 
the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions 
about the data.
